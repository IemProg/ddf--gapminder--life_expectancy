### Revision history

2016 October 12: Added the latest IHME data from 1990 to 2015, plus extended them 
with a simple linear extrapolation to 2016, as I don't expect any better data during 
next year. /Ola

2015 October: Used new IHME data, whenever available 1970 to 2013 and extended
to 2015

2014-11-20: Version 8: included WPP estimates for 2013. Added temporary
guesstimates for Taiwan & Greenland for 2013 (these two guestimates are not
inlcuded in the gapdata file). 

2014-05-07: Version 7: added guesstimates for disasters etc. Changed what years
to include.

Here's a short summary of the Gapminder Historic Life expectancy main components:

- Data before 1970, are collected of estimates of average life expectancy from different
sources. The main sources used:
  1. Human Mortality Database, www.mortality.org
  2. World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision / United Nations Population
  Division, with projections
  3. Publications and files by history prof. James C Riley
  4. Human Lifetable Database, www.lifetable.de
  5. Miscellaneous sources, see full documentation
- where no estimates are available form any source, before 1950, we constructed, simple
model for showing levels and changes in historical life expectancy, mainly based on
Infant Mortality Rate data.
